# Electronic Dice with ATmega328P

This repository documents a complete engineering design cycle for a multi-sided electronic dice. The project covers the entire development process, from initial problem definition and component research to detailed schematic design, PCB layout, software development, and 3D enclosure modeling. While a physical prototype was not assembled, all engineering stages for a production-ready device were completed.

The final design is a compact, key-fob-sized device featuring a rechargeable LiPo battery, USB-C charging, and a dual 7-segment display.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Sided Dice:** Supports d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 dice types, selectable via a tactile button.
* **Compact Design:** The final PCB measures just 38 x 48 mm.
* **Clear Display:** Utilizes two 7-segment displays with multiplexing to clearly show roll results.
* **Rechargeable:** Powered by a 150mAh LiPo battery with on-board USB charging via a TP4057 IC.
* **Power Management:** Includes an LM2731 step-up voltage regulator to provide a stable 5V supply to all components.
