# Electronic Dice with ATmega328P

This repository documents a complete engineering design cycle for a multi-sided electronic dice. The project covers the entire development process, from initial problem definition and component research to detailed schematic design, PCB layout, software development, and 3D enclosure modeling. While a physical prototype was not assembled, all engineering stages for a production-ready device were completed.

The final design is a compact, key-fob-sized device featuring a rechargeable LiPo battery, USB-C charging, and a dual 7-segment display.

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Engineering Process

This project followed a structured engineering lifecycle to ensure all objectives were met efficiently and reliably.

1. **Problem Definition:** Defined client requirements, project objectives, and created a Gantt chart for project planning.

2. **Research & Feasibility:** Analyzed existing products and sourced compatible, cost-effective components (ATmega328P, 7-segment displays, etc.). A full feasibility assessment (Technical, Economic, Operational) was conducted.

3. **Concept Design:**
   
    * **Software:** Developed the logic flow, including dice type selection, random number generation, and display multiplexing.
    * **Hardware:** Created a detailed schematic, outlining power management, microcontroller connections, and user interface components.

4. **PCB & Enclosure Design:**

    * Designed a compact, two-layer PCB using KiCad, optimized for size and signal integrity.
    * Modeled a custom 3D-printable enclosure in Autodesk Fusion 360 to house all components securely.

5. **Simulation & Validation:** The core logic was tested in a simulated breadboard environment to validate the software and hardware interaction before finalization.
